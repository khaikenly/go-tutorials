# Go Syntax

#  - A Go file consists of the following parts:
#   + Package declaration
#   + Import packages
#   + Functions
#   + Statements and expressions


#  - Go variable naming rules:
#   + A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character (_)
#   + A variable name cannot start with a digit
#   + A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ )
#   + Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
#   + There is no limit on the length of the variable name
#   + A variable name cannot contain spaces
#   + The variable name cannot be any Go keywords

        # Multi-Word Variable Names
        # Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

        # There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

        # Camel Case
        # Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
        # myVariableName = "John"

        # Pascal Case
        # Each word starts with a capital letter:
        # MyVariableName = "John"

        # Snake Case
        # Each word is separated by an underscore character:
        # my_variable_name = "John"

#  - Five Important Questions
#   + How do we run the code in our project?
        # + 'go build' -> compiles a bunch of go source code files
        # + 'go run' -> compiles and executes one or two file
        # + 'go fmt' -> formats all the code in each file in the current directory
        # + 'go install' -> compiles and "installs" a package
        # + 'go get' -> downloads the raw source code of someone else's package
        # + 'go test' -> run any tests associated with the current project
#   + What does 'package main' mean?
        # + 'package main' -> compiled and then *executes*. Must have a func called main
        # + 'package __' -> dependency (helper code)
#   + What does 'import "fmt"' mean?
        # + Standard lib of golang (golang.org/pkg)
#   + What's that 'func' thing?
#   + How is the main.go file organized?
